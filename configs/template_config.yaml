# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# For running on SCC:
#    Enter list of animals to run behavior analysis. These list of animals should already have a folder in the "processing_folder"
#    with a .csv file that contains the trials queried from DataJoint
#    (If you want to run analysis on all animals in processing_folder, set first entry as "all") 
# 
# For running on local Windows
#    Enter list of animals to run behavior analysis on. These list of animals DO NOT need to have a folder in the "processing_folder"
